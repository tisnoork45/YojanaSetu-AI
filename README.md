# YojanaSetu AI

An **AI-powered Government Scheme Recommendation System** built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. YojanaSetu enables users to discover relevant Indian government welfare schemes through natural language queries by combining **semantic search using SBERT**, **vector similarity search using FAISS**, and **Google Gemini** for intelligent, context-aware recommendations.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters a query in natural language.
2. SBERT converts the query into a semantic embedding.
3. FAISS retrieves the most relevant government schemes based on semantic similarity.
4. Retrieved scheme information is provided as context to Google Gemini.
5. Gemini generates a personalized recommendation using the retrieved information.
6. The final response is displayed through a Gradio chatbot interface.

## 📈 Evaluation

The chatbot was evaluated using an **LLM-as-a-Judge** framework.

### Evaluation Domains

- 🏠 Housing
- 🎓 Education
- ❤️ Health
- 💼 Business
- 👴 Pension

A separate Gemini instance compared chatbot responses with predefined expected facts and assigned scores on a scale of **1–5**.

**⭐ Average Evaluation Score: 4.60 / 5.0**

## 💬 Example Query

```text
I am a farmer with 2 acres of land. Can I get financial help?
```

### Example Response

```text
Recommended Scheme:
PM-KISAN

Benefits:
• ₹6000 annual financial assistance
• Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)

Reason:
Based on your profile, PM-KISAN is the most suitable scheme for your needs.
```
